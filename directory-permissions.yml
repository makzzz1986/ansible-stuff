# One day I stuck with recursive mode of file module
# It will recursively change all permissions deeper from path,
# but what if I created a subfolder in folder without o+x permission for user?
# He can't use his folder if he doesn't have permissions on all top levels
# I spend two days to solve this issue, so reverse recursive mode:

    - name: Example of path
        set_fact:
          string: /tmp/subtemp/anotherone/lastone

    - name: Ensure that all folder with right permissions
      vars:
        counter: "{{ range(2, string.split('/')|length + 1) |list }}"
      file:
        path : "{{ string.split('/')|batch(item)|list|first|join('/') }}"
        state: directory
        owner: user
        group: user
        mode : o+x
      with_items: "{{ counter }}"

# Be carefull of permissions! 
# It will try to chmod all tree of path, if you don't want to change subroot folder parmissions,
# change range(2, ...) to range(3, ...)
